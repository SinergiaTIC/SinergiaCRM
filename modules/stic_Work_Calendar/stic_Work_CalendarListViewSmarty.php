/**
 * If the all_day field is checked, the hours:minutes section of the start_date and end_date fields should be removed. 
 * Need to take into account that dates might change depending on the timezone.
 *
 * As all_day field is not included by default (or should have been removed by the user) in the listview, 
 * it is explicitly included in the 'custom_select' property of the $params array just before calling the 
 * setup() function, that will retrieve the data.
 *
 * This is done by creating this custom class instead of working in parent::display() in the view.list.php
 * (which would be the usual way) because the $params array is completely overrided in the listViewPrepare() 
 * SuiteCRM core method (include/MVC/View/views/view.list.php#L245). This might be a core bug. Anyway,
 * here is the workaround.
 *
 * Before sending the data to the smarty template, date fields are properly formatted using the function formatDateFields()
