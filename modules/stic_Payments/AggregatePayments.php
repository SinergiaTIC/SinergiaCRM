/**
 * It runs the functionality for aggregated services payments. It will group the corresponding attendances into their matching
 * payments, calculating the total amount to be charged.
 *
 * Considering payments in the current month and attendances within the periodicity of the related payment commitments, it does:
 * 1. Search for warning attendances: they should be aggregated in a payment but they can't due to lack of status and payment_exception values.
 * 2. Search for includable attendances/payments: unpaid aggregated services payments and attendances with status "Yes" or "Partially" or with payment_exception "Include".
 * 3. Remove the previously related attendances that those payments may have
 * 4. Relate all the includable attendances to the proper payments
 * 5. Update the payment amount as the sum of the related attendances amounts.
 * 6. For those payments that are "complete" (no warning attendances), the field aggregated_services_complete is checked.
 * 7. Search for warning payments: payments that should be included but don't have any includable attendance.
 * 8. Send all the data to the custom aggregated view in order to be display a summary and a warnings table.
